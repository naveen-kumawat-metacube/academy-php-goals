                <h4 class="card-title">MySQL Database</h4>
                <p>
                MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is the most popular database system used with PHP. MySQL is developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The data in a MySQL database are stored in tables which consists of columns and rows.</li>
                  <li>MySQL is a database system that runs on a server.</li>
                  <li>MySQL is ideal for both small and large applications.</li>
                  <li>MySQL is very fast, reliable, and easy to use database system.It uses standard SQL</li>
                  <li>MySQL compiles on a number of platforms.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  <strong>Connecting to MySQL database using PHP: </strong> There are 3 ways in which we can connect to MySQl from PHP as listed above and described below:
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Using MySQLi object-oriented procedure: </strong>We can use the MySQLi object-oriented procedure to establish a connection to MySQL database from a PHP script. 
                </p>
                <pre>
                $servername = "localhost";
                $username = "username";
                $password = "password";

                // Creating connection
                $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password);

                // Checking connection
                if ($conn->connect_error) {
                    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
                } 
                echo "Connected successfully";
                </pre>
                <p>Explanation: We can create an instance of the mysqli class providing all the necessary details required to establish the connection such as host, username, password etc. If the instance is created successfully then the connection is successful otherwise there is some error in establishing connection. </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Using MySQLi procedural procedure: </strong>There is also a procedural approach of MySQLi to establish a connection to MySQL database from a PHP script as described below. 
                </p>
                <pre>
                $servername = "localhost";
                $username = "username";
                $password = "password";

                // Creating connection
                $conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password);

                // Checking connection
                if (!$conn) {
                    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
                }
                echo "Connected successfully";
                </pre>
                <p>Explanation: In MySQLi procedural approach instead of creating an instance we can use the mysqli_connect() function available in PHP to establish a connection. This function takes the information as arguments such as host, username , password , database name etc. This function returns MySQL link identifier on successful connection or FALSE when failed to establish a connection. </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Using PDO procedure: </strong>PDO stands for PHP Data Objects. That is, in this method we connect to the database using data objects in PHP as described below: 
                </p>
                <pre>
                $servername = "localhost";
                $username = "username";
                $password = "password";

                try {
                    $conn = new PDO("mysql:host=$servername;dbname=myDB", $username, $password);
                    // setting the PDO error mode to exception
                    $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
                    echo "Connected successfully"; 
                    }
                catch(PDOException $e)
                    {
                    echo "Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage();
                    }
                </pre>
                <p>Explanation:The exception class in PDO is used to handle any problems that may occur in our database queries. If an exception is thrown within the try{ } block, the script stops executing and flows directly to the first catch(){ } block. </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Closing A Connection: </strong>When we establish a connection to MySQL database from a PHP script , we should also disconnect or close the connection when our work is finished. Here we have described the syntax of closing the connection to a MySQL database in all 3 methods described above. We have assumed that the reference to the connection is stored in $conn variable.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Using MySQLi object oriented procedure </strong> $conn->close();</li>
                  <li><strong>Using MySQLi procedural procedure </strong> mysqli_close($conn);</li>
                  <li><strong>Using PDO procedure </strong> $conn = null;</li>
                </ul>

                  <h4 class="card-title">DDL Statements</h4>
                  <p>
                  The DDL Commands in Structured Query Language are used to create and modify the schema of the database and its objects. The syntax of DDL commands is predefined for describing the data. The commands of Data Definition Language deal with how the data should exist in the database.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Following are the five DDL commands in SQL:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>CREATE Command</li>
                    <li>DROP Command</li>
                    <li>ALTER Command</li>
                    <li>TRUNCATE Command</li>
                    <li>RENAME Command</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    <strong>CREATE Command</strong>: CREATE is a DDL command used to create databases, tables, triggers and other database objects.
                  </p>

                  ON [table_name] ; 
                  </pre>

                  <p><strong>DROP Command: </strong>DROP is a DDL command used to delete/remove the database objects from the SQL database. We can easily remove the entire table, view, or index from the database using this DDL command.</p>

                  <p><strong>Remove a Database:</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>ALTER Command: </strong>ALTER is a DDL command which changes or modifies the existing structure of the database, and it also changes the schema of database objects.</p>
                  <p>We can also add and drop constraints of the table using the ALTER command.</p>

                  <p>DML is an abbreviation of Data Manipulation Language.</p>
                  <p>
                  The DML commands in Structured Query Language change the data present in the SQL database. We can easily access, store, modify, update and delete the existing records from the database using DML commands.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Following are the four main DML commands in SQL:</strong></p>

                    <li>SELECT Command</li>
                    <li>INSERT Command</li>

                    <li>DELETE Command</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    <strong>SELECT Command: </strong> SELECT is the most important data manipulation command in Structured Query Language. The SELECT command shows the records of the specified table. It also shows the particular record of a particular column by using the WHERE clause.

                  <p>
                  Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations. It is also used to eliminate undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Normalization divides the larger table into smaller and links them using relationships.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Why do we need Normalization?</strong>
                    The main reason for normalizing the relations is removing these anomalies. Failure to eliminate anomalies leads to data redundancy and can cause data integrity and other problems as the database grows. Normalization consists of a series of guidelines that helps to guide you in creating a good database structure.
                  </p>

                  <p>Data modification anomalies can be categorized into three types:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Insertion Anomaly: </strong>
                      Insertion Anomaly refers to when one cannot insert a new tuple into a relationship due to lack of data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Deletion Anomaly: </strong>
                      The delete anomaly refers to the situation where the deletion of data results in the unintended loss of some other important data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Updatation Anomaly: </strong>
                      The update anomaly is when an update of a single data value requires multiple rows of data to be updated.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Types of Normal Forms:
                    Normalization works through a series of stages called Normal forms. The normal forms apply to individual relations. The relation is said to be in particular normal form if it satisfies constraints.
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Following are the various types of Normal forms:</strong>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                    Normalization helps to minimize data redundancy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Greater overall database organization.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Data consistency within the database.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Much more flexible database design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Enforces the concept of relational integrity.

                  <p><strong>Disadvantages of Normalization</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                    You cannot start building the database before knowing what the user needs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    The performance degrades when normalizing the relations to higher normal forms, i.e., 4NF, 5NF.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    It is very time-consuming and difficult to normalize relations of a higher degree.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Careless decomposition may lead to a bad database design, leading to serious problems.

                  <p>
                    <strong>First Normal Form (1NF): </strong>
                    A relation will be 1NF if it contains an atomic value.

                  <p>
                  It states that an attribute of a table cannot hold multiple values. It must hold only single-valued attribute.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  First normal form disallows the multi-valued attribute, composite attribute, and their combinations.

                  The given STUDENT table is in 3NF, but the COURSE and HOBBY are two independent entity. Hence, there is no relationship between COURSE and HOBBY.

                  <p>
                  In the STUDENT relation, a student with STU_ID, 21 contains two courses, Computer and Math and two hobbies, Dancing and Singing. So there is a Multi-valued dependency on STU_ID, which leads to unnecessary repetition of data.

                  In the above table, John takes both Computer and Math class for Semester 1 but he doesn't take Math class for Semester 2. In this case, combination of all these fields required to identify a valid data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Suppose we add a new Semester as Semester 3 but do not know about the subject and who will be taking that subject so we leave Lecturer and Subject as NULL. But all three columns together acts as a primary key, so we can't leave other two columns blank.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  So to make the above table into 5NF, we can decompose it into three relations P1, P2 & P3:
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>P1</strong></p>
